<p>OK. I’m. I get the bachelor’s degree and the master’s degree from  University in 2016 and 2018 respectively. And now I’ve worked in the PAI department in Alibaba Group for almost 4 years. The PAI is the short of Platform of Artificial Intelligence.<br>
Duration these time, there are two major stages which could be separated roughly according my promotion. As written in the resume, in the software engineer stage, from 2018 to 2020, I worked mainly on two projects. The first is the hardware accelerator of the deep learning model. We accelerated several models mainly on CV, TTS, NLP and recommendation based on Tensorflow model. I wrote the logic of hardware in Verilog and the code of runtime capable of data manipulation in C++. And we use Tensorflow as a complement handling the operations which our hardware accelerators not supported. The second is the optimization of the inference performance. We’ve tried different ways for both GPU and CPU, including TensorRT, TVM and so on. We packed different methods into a tool called Blade, which is now been used in company.<br>
In the second stage as a senior software engineer, I worked mainly on the application of AI, which consists of tuning model, developing SDK and service’s backend, commercialize product by integrating with Ali Cloud’s infrastructures. There are three projects I worked on. The first is the light-weighted recommendation system for medium and small companies. (why?) The second is the marketing platform using AI to predict the probability of user’s certain behavior and helping to increase the rate of click, recall and conversion. (more detail?) The third is the video processing platform with the ability of AI enhancement. (how do you deal with the thousands of jobs concurrently).</p>

<h2><a href="#would-you-like-to-work-overtime-or-odd-hours" class="header-anchor">#</a><span id="would-you-like-to-work-overtime-or-odd-hours"> Would you like to work overtime or odd hours?</span></h2>
<p>You should become very honest to answer this question. Don’t tell a lie or compromise to get the job only. If you don’t have any problem, you can answer like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that in the company being asked to work for an extended number of hours comes with a good reason, so I am ok with it. It an extra effort means I am doing something for the company, I’ll be happy to do it.</p>

<p>This is a very tricky question. The work should always be more important than the money. This frame of mind is good for you(at least at the time of interview).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Money is always important, but the work is most important for me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possible Answer 2</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Possible Answer 3</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Possible Answer 4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think money probably matters to me about as much as it does to anyone. It’s vital and necessary for us to live and prosper but, at the same time, it’s not my single most important driving force. I believe that money is rewarded for work.”</p>

I was delighted to see on your company website that your employees are talking about how great it is to work for your company.

<h2><a href="#why-did-you-leave-your-last-job" class="header-anchor">#</a><span id="why-did-you-leave-your-last-job"> Why did you leave your last job?</span></h2>
<p>You should be very careful with this question. Avoid trashing other employers and making a statement like “I need more money”. Instead of this, you can say that:</p>
<blockquote>
