<p>I was hoping you’d ask that.</p>
<p>Recruiter: Hiring people meeting the job Requirements.<br>
Hire Manager: Maybe your future boss.</p>
<p>How you meet all the requirement of the job.</p>
<p>Well, as I understand it, you’re looking for someone who:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go down the list of job requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personality.<br>
Desire.</p>
<p>Highlight each requirement.</p>
<p>Tree years experience in this. Yes I actually have 5.</p>
<h1><a href="#what-are-your-expected-salary" class="header-anchor">#</a><span id="what-are-your-expected-salary"> What are your expected salary?</span></h1>
<p>If they ask you this question during the last round of interviews maybe they are actually interested in accommodating your compensation expectations.</p>
<p>However when they ask you this question at an early stage like in your first job interview they’re not asking it because they want to accommodate you they’re asking it because they’re trying to eliminate you as a candidate.</p>
<p>Avoid giving a single number.</p>
<p>If you’re in the first or two interviews into the process</p>
<ol>
<li>I need more details.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Well at this point, I need to know quite a bit more of the details about the role before it can really give you an accurate answer on that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What details do you need?</p>
<p>Technically I would need to know how it works with the official job hours and overtime and shift work, travel requirements, breaks benefits, flex time, remote work and general job demands. But it’s easier to say well maybe just more of a feel for the culture in general and then go straight to the second part and ask for the approved salary range.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Ask for the approved salary range.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now if they’re not satisfied with this and they press you further to give a number.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand this is an approved position, so the salary range must be approved. Can I ask what it is for this position.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Give a wide range.<br>
If the recruiter insists that you should give a specific number, describe a range of number. Never speak a specific number.</li>
</ol>

<p>Blind Prediction. Get dirt.</p>
<p>Hidden elimination criteria.</p>
<p>More talk = bad.</p>
<p>Conversations are better than interrogations.</p>
<p>Turn the interview into a conversation rather than an interrogation.</p>
<p>End with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does that fit in with what you’re looking for?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I expect to be advancing based on my job performance, and likely taking on some new job responsibilities.<br>
Do you mind me asking where you see this compony going in the future?<br>
What is the long term plan of this department?</p>

<p>You should become very honest to answer this question. Don’t tell a lie or compromise to get the job only. If you don’t have any problem, you can answer like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that in the company being asked to work for an extended number of hours comes with a good reason, so I am ok with it. It an extra effort means I am doing something for the company, I’ll be happy to do it.</p>

<h2><a href="#what-is-more-important-to-you-the-money-or-the-work" class="header-anchor">#</a><span id="what-is-more-important-to-you-the-money-or-the-work"> What is more important to you: the money or the work?</span></h2>
<p>This is a very tricky question. The work should always be more important than the money. This frame of mind is good for you(at least at the time of interview).</p>
<p>Possible Answer 1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Money is always important, but the work is most important for me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possible Answer 2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I would say that work is more important. If we work and achieve Company goals then obviously money would follow. I believe work to be prior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possible Answer 3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Work is more important for me. Working just for money may not be fulfilled if I don’t feel satisfied with my job. My work makes me stay productive, and money would naturally come along well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possible Answer 4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think money probably matters to me about as much as it does to anyone. It’s vital and necessary for us to live and prosper but, at the same time, it’s not my single most important driving force. I believe that money is rewarded for work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#what-do-you-know-about-this-organization" class="header-anchor">#</a><span id="what-do-you-know-about-this-organization"> What do you know about this organization?</span></h2>
<p>You should fully aware of that organization where you are going for an interview, so check the history, present structure and working style of that organization. Check the company’s website, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn pages to gather the information.</p>
<p>Possible Answer 1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We all know that it is one of the fastest growing infrastructure company in India. The facilities provided to the employee is best. People feel proud to be the part of your company as the company provides full support to their employees in professional front. The working environment of this company is decent. It has crossed the branches in the world also. And I was in search of this type of company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Possible Answer 2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We all know that this company is India’s no.1 company for development. I was delighted to see on your company website that your employees are talking about how great it is to work for your company. Now these days, so many people seem to hate the company where they work for one reason or another. It’s great to see that your employees are proud to talk about how much they love their company and jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#why-did-you-leave-your-last-job" class="header-anchor">#</a><span id="why-did-you-leave-your-last-job"> Why did you leave your last job?</span></h2>
<p>You should be very careful with this question. Avoid trashing other employers and making a statement like “I need more money”. Instead of this, you can say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, it’s a career move. I have learned a lot from my last job, but now I am looking for new challenges to broaden my horizons and to gain a new skill-set.</p>
